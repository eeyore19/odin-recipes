    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the
      type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with<br />
      several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as
      meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>12 whole wheat lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil
        over high heat. Once the water is boiling, add the lasagna noodles a few
        at a time, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring
        occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to
        the bite, about 10 minutes. Remove the noodles to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the ground beef into a skillet over medium heat, add the garlic,
        garlic powder, oregano, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Cook the
        meat, chopping it into small chunks as it cooks, until no longer pink,
        about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, mix the cottage cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese until
        thoroughly combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 4 noodles side by side into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan;
        top with a layer of the tomato-basil sauce, a layer of ground beef
        mixture, and a layer of the cottage cheese mixture. Repeat layers twice
        more, ending with a layer of sauce; sprinkle top with the mozzarella
        cheese. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling and the
        cheese has melted, about 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake until cheese
        has begun to brown, about 10 more minutes. Allow to stand at least 10
        minutes before serving.
