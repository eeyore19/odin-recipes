    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      This is a thick, rich butternut squash soup with tons of flavor. Something
      I whipped up off the top of my head, with things I had on hand.<br />
      Super easy, quick, and a great way to use squash. An instant hit at my
      house.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sauted butter</li>
      <li>Onion,Celery,Carrots, and Potatoes</li>
      <li>2 pound pre-cut butternut squash</li>
      <li>Chciken Stock</li>
      <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the squash in half crosswise, separating the "bulb" from the "tube."
        Slice the stem and the bottom of the bulb off and stand both pieces on a
        flat surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a vegetable peeler to peel away the skin from top to bottom. Once
        both are peeled, cut each piece in half, scoop out the seeds, and chop.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Some reviewers suggest using the microwave to
        soften the skin prior to peeling. To do so, simply use a fork to poke
        holes in the squash and pop the whole squash microwave for 2-3 minutes.
        Then follow the above steps for peeling.
